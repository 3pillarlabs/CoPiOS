# Measurements

## Overview

Starting with iOS 10, Apple created new classes in Foundation framework which can be used to associate a value with a unit, performs conversions between units within same dimension. Using this abstraction, we may create complex features with little work and high business value.

In this session you may find how to use the built-in units, extend when neeeded and create your own.
