# Self-sizing cells
## Overview

In the past we used to do fixed layout within cells in `UITableView` and `UICollectionView`. Often, the data shown in the cells either received from a server or it is required to be dynamic. AutoLayout has been published to help developers accomodate to different size classes and simplify the work needed to layout information on devices.

Due to all these requirements and challanges, there is a new way to architect cells with minimal work!
