# Resurrection of MVC
## Overview

Often we tried various software architectures on iOS platform in order to achive simpler, cleaner code. No matter how many tries we had, in the end we realized that we did a lot of work to make it work with UIKit.

This we have another try, but with a variation of MVC called Hierarchical MVC.

The [slides](Slides---diagrams) provides a brief history of MVC and the demos ([Basic MVC](Demo/Basic-MVC) and [Cell View Controllers](Demo/CellViewControllers)) provides a way to implement Hierarchical MVC.

For further reading, I invite you to access the references.
